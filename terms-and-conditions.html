					<h2 class="wow fadeInUp">Therapy Terms &amp; Client Policies</h2>
					<p>We at Jevan Journey think it’s great that you decided to take up therapy and acknowledge your feelings. Not many people are able to make this decision, and we are proud of you (we hope you are proud of yourself too!)</p>
					<p>A consent form will be shared with you by your psychologist before the therapy process begins. By signing the consent form, you grant permission for us to provide therapy services aimed at supporting your well-being. The policies mentioned on this website, or the consent form may be subject to change without prior notice.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Mental Health Services</h3>
					<p>We will be providing ‘therapy/counselling’ to you using an eclectic approach. This means that we do not use only one approach towards therapy as we recognise that different people may need different techniques and methodologies to feel better. We are open to feedback and encourage you to tell us in case something makes you uncomfortable.</p>
					<p>We will not be able to provide you ‘support’ (any communication over calls/text) in a ‘crisis’ (self-harm/emergency/harmful situation). Our services are limited to the one (1) hour of sessions we take. The booking of appointment slots is done via messages outside of these sessions.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Appointments and Cancellations</h3>
					<p>Payment for all sessions must be made in advance within 12 hours of deciding the slot to confirm the session.</p>
					<p>If payment is not made in advance, the slot is liable to be assigned to someone else who has completed the payment within time.</p>
					<p>We accept payments from both national and international clients via all UPI apps such as GPay, PayTM, PhonePe, as well as PayPal and direct bank transfer.</p>
					<p>We accept credit and debit cards as well; however, due to the payment processing app’s high fees, we levy an additional charge per session. A unique link will be shared for each individual payment in case of payment via card.</p>
					<p>Please send payment confirmation screenshots to our official WhatsApp number for verification. Do not send screenshots to your therapist directly. Please note that the screenshot is not to be shared with the therapist for confirmation as they’re not in charge of the verification process.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Reschedule Policy</h3>
					<p>Sessions can only be rescheduled free of charge up to 24 hours in advance.</p>
					<p>In case of a reschedule or cancellation, the client must inform <b>both</b> the therapist as well as the admin team at least 24 hours in advance.</p>
					<p><b>No refunds</b> will be available if sessions are cancelled or rescheduled less than 24 hours prior to the session start time, and the session will be considered as a last-minute cancellation.</p>
					<p>If the client does not join the session within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time, the session will be considered as a no-show and no refunds/reschedules will be possible.</p>
					<p>A new slot will have to be booked, and payment is to be made again to confirm the new slot.</p>
					<p>In case of a reschedule from the therapist/psychologist’s end, you will be informed in advance as well.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Confidentiality</h3>
					<p>The sessions will be completely confidential and private between you and the therapist. The only record of the session that will exist is any notes that the therapist takes as part of the process of therapy which is solely available to the therapist/psychologist. Your personal information will not be shared without your consent, except as required by law.</p>
					<p>You agree to use a secure line/connection for these consultations, in a relatively quiet and private space. No audio or video recording of the session (either on mobile, using an app or online) is to be performed and the proceedings of this consultation are strictly confidential and must not be shared with any other individual or agency without explicit consent and prior notification.</p>
					<p>You understand and agree that you or your relatives should not record, share, or disseminate the content of these sessions to third parties or on social media.</p>
					<p>However, despite safety measures taken, there are chances for breach in security in technology. In such instances, both client and psychotherapist will not hold the other responsible for the breach.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Mental Health Act</h3>
					<p>A person with mental illness shall have the right to confidentiality in respect of their mental health, mental healthcare, treatment and physical healthcare.</p>
					<p>All health professionals providing care or treatment to a person with mental illness shall have a duty to keep all such information confidential which has been obtained during care or treatment with the following exceptions, namely:</p>
					<ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
					<li>release of information to the nominated representative to enable them to fulfill their duties under this Act;</li>
					<li>release of information to other mental health professionals and other health professionals to enable them to provide care and treatment to the person with mental illness;</li>
					<li>release of information if it is necessary to protect any other person from harm or violence;</li>
					<li>only such information that is necessary to protect against the harm identified shall be released;</li>
					<li>release only such information as is necessary to prevent threat to life;</li>
					<li>release of information upon an order by concerned Board or the Central Authority or High Court or Supreme Court or any other statutory authority competent to do so;</li>
					<li>release of information in the interests of public safety and security;</li>
					<li>information accessible to the administration team of Jevan Journey for smooth functioning of the organisation;</li>
					<li>information accessible to supervisors of therapists to ensure quality of sessions is maintained for all clients.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Minors</h3>
					<p>If you are under 18 years of age, please be aware that the law may provide your parents the right to examine your treatment records. It is our policy to request that we will provide parents only with general information about our work together, unless we feel there is a high risk that you will seriously harm yourself or someone else.</p>
					<p>In this case, we will notify them of our concerns. We will also provide them with a summary of your treatment when it is complete. Before giving them any information, we will discuss the matter with you, if possible, and do our best to handle any objections you may have about it. A letter of consent will be requested if the client is a minor. The letter of consent is to be signed by a legal adult who may or may not be their parent.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Duty to Warn</h3>
					<p>If we believe you are a danger to yourself or others, we may inform relevant authorities, including law enforcement or medical personnel, to prevent harm.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Interaction Beyond Sessions</h3>
					<p>Our relationship will be a professional and therapeutic one. To preserve this relationship, it is imperative that we do not have any other type of relationship with you. Personal and/or business relationships undermine the effectiveness of the therapeutic relationship. We care about helping you but are not able to be your friend or to have a social and personal relationship with you. Gifts, bartering, and trading services are strictly prohibited and must not be shared/exchanged.</p>
					<p>Therapy is a way for you to become independent and self-reliant. For this purpose, we will not be able to text or call outside of our sessions unless it is to discuss session timings.</p>
					<p>Any information available on Jevan Journey's website/social media is not therapy and is only available for awareness. It is not a substitute for therapy or a helpline.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Consent to Transfer</h3>
					<p>By signing the consent form, you agree not to engage in private sessions with the therapist outside of Jevan Journey during or after their affiliation with the organisation. In case Jevan Journey discontinues working with a therapist, you consent to being transferred to another therapist on the team.</p>
					<p>By signing the consent form, you authorise Jevan Journey to maintain and share your case notes within the organisation as needed, ensuring confidentiality. These notes will not be shared outside the organisation without your explicit consent.</p>
					<p>By signing the consent form, you understand that taking sessions with the therapist privately (as defined above) is against the legal contract between the therapist and Jevan Journey.</p>
					<p>This restriction is in place as the therapists are no longer obligated to follow Jevan Journey’s code of professionalism and ethics once they leave the team. Jevan Journey does not want any harm to be caused to the clients as Jevan Journey can no longer monitor the quality of the therapist’s work once work is discontinued with them. This consent form will not apply to the therapist in case they are no longer an employee of Jevan Journey. You will be informed about the same in case such a situation arises.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Length and Number of Sessions</h3>
					<p>Each session will last 60 minutes (one hour).</p>
					<p>You may request additional time in 30-minute (half an hour) increments or request for a double session (defined as 120 minutes/two hours) if deemed necessary after your initial interactions with your therapist.</p>
					<p>Any additional time beyond the defined 60 minutes (one hour) of scheduled session is chargeable. Additional charges for this will be communicated to you at the time of the booking.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Consent to Treatment</h3>
					<p>A consent form will be shared with you before any therapy is initiated. The consent form is an agreement for treatment between you (the client) and Jevan Journey.</p>
					<p>By signing the consent form you voluntarily agree to receive mental health assessments, care, treatment, or services and authorise us to provide such care, treatment, or services as are considered necessary and advisable by Jevan Journey. Signing the consent form indicates that you understand and agree that you will participate in the planning of your care, treatment, or services, and that you may stop such care, treatment, or services at any time. By signing the consent form, you acknowledge that you have both read and understood all the terms and information contained herein.</p>
					<p>Therapists at Jevan Journey reserve the right to discontinue therapy owing to their mental health and sense of security. Any person who displays lewd or indecent behaviour or makes the staff feel uncomfortable or unsafe will not be provided the services.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Risks and Benefits of Therapy</h3>
					<p>Psychotherapy is a joint effort between the client(s) and the therapist. Progress and success may vary depending upon the problems or issues being addressed,</p>
					<p>as well as many other factors. Participating in therapy may result in several benefits, including, but not limited to, reduced stress and anxiety, increased ability to relate to others, a decrease in negative thoughts and self-sabotaging behaviour, improved interpersonal relationships, increased comfort in school, work, and family settings, increased capacity for intimacy, and increased self-confidence. Such benefits may also require substantial effort on the part of the client(s), including active participation in the therapeutic process, honesty, and a willingness to change feelings, thoughts and behaviour. There is no guarantee that therapy will yield any or all the benefits listed above.</p>
					<p>Participating in therapy may also involve some discomfort, including remembering and discussing unpleasant events, feelings and experiences. The process may evoke strong feelings of sadness, anger, fear, etc. There may be times in which clients' perceptions and assumptions are challenged, and different perspectives offered. The issues presented by clients may result in unintended outcomes, including changes in personal relationships. Clients should be aware that any decision on the status of his/her personal relationships is your responsibility. During the therapeutic process, many clients find that they feel worse before they feel better. This is generally a normal course of events. Personal growth and change may be easy and swift at times, but may also be slow and frustrating. You may address any concerns you have regarding progress during your session. If you are the parent/representative of a client, there are limits to what will and will not be discussed in the course of treatment. These expectations will be clarified with you before treatment begins.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Harm to Oneself</h3>
					<p>Suicide, or ending one’s own life, is a tragic event with strong emotional repercussions for its survivors & for families of its victims. Every therapist’s attempt is to prevent such an unfortunate event from occurring. However, it is an impulsive act & under such unpredictable circumstances, a therapist or Jevan Journey cannot be held liable for it.</p>
					<p>It is important to note that Jevan Journey is <b>not</b> a crisis intervention center and therefore does <b>not</b> provide emergency services. Services are rendered only during the scheduled sessions. Clients who have an emergency must use local and available emergency resources.</p>
					<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Participation in Litigation</h3>
					<p>We will not voluntarily participate in any litigation, or custody dispute in which client and another individual, or entity, are parties. We have a policy of not communicating with client’s attorney and will generally not write or sign letters, reports, declarations, or affidavits to be used in a legal matter unless agreed upon at the beginning of the therapeutic relationship. We will generally not provide records or testimony unless compelled to do so. Should we be subpoenaed, or ordered by a court of law, to appear as a witness in an action involving a client; the client agrees to reimburse us for any time spent or preparation, travel, or other time in which we have made ourselves available for such an appearance at our usual and customary fees.</p>
					<p>Jevan Journey is not to be held liable for any criminal actions conducted by therapists working at Jevan Journey.</p>
